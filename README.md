## Introduction to Quake 3 log parser

Quake 3 log parser is a script to process and make reports of a log file generated by a Quake 3 Arena server.

## Prerequisites
For manual installation:
* Ruby 3.0.0 (I strongly recommend to install it via [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install))

For Docker installation:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Install and run manually

Having fulfilled all the prerequisites for this kind of installation you will need to follow some steps in order to setup correctly the project.

Steps to proceed:
* ```bundle install``` Will install all dependencies.
* ```./bin/log_processor``` Will run the script with the default [log](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/be1b636e58abff14088c8b5309f575d8) file.
* ```./bin/log_processor 'file_path'``` Will run the script with your local log file.

As a result two report files will be generated inside ./tmp/reports.

The file with the prefix games ( games_random_urlsafe_base64.json ) contain the report of grouped information for each match.

The file with the prefix deaths ( deaths_random_urlsafe_base64.json ) contain the report of deaths, grouped by death cause for each match.
 
## Install and run with Docker

Also with Docker we can get the project up and run it.

Steps to proceed:
* ```docker-compose build``` Will build the image needed.

* ```docker-compose up``` Will run the script with the default [log](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/be1b636e58abff14088c8b5309f575d8) file.

To process your local log file in the container, add a volume in the docker-compose.yml
* ```- <your_local_log_file_path>:/app/log/qgames.log```

Two report files will be generated inside the container in the path /app/tmp/reports, but thank's to the volume in the docker-compose.yml you will get the reports on the same folder as the manual execution (./tmp/reports) 

## How to TEST

Tests are very important and are the basis of a good software project.

If you want to check if tests are passing you only need to run the command ```bundle exec rspec```. This command will run ALL the tests.

But there's more options, you'll see a table below with the options:

| Option                                                    | Command                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Only one file                                             | ```bundle exec rspec spec/lib/game_parser_spec.rb```     |
| Only one specific describe/context/it (get line number)   | ```bundle exec rspec spec/lib/game_parser_spec.rb:70``` |
